# Restaurant-Recommendation
its an basic project that has been done by our group while studying 3rd year as per our academics.
its an real time restaurant recommendation we did gathered the restaurant information by visiting and gathered reviews 
from different sites and also from the real customers.
Restaurants gathered  are from some of the greater localities in visakhapatnam.
we used django to develop this project, though it has lacked many times like logout option and customer statisfaction.
As this is just for our course purpose and wehave to do it in just 1 month, so we tried our level best to complete the project.
any corrections or suggestions are highly appreciated. though we havent done it greatly but i think it may be useful to those who are interested in doing 
some great things.
